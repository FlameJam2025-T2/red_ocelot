ðŸš€ Red Ocelot
DESCRIPTION

This game was made for Flame Jam 2025, on the theme of "The Space Race."
Red Ocelot is a fast-paced space shooter where you pilot a rocket ship between clusters of enemies scattered across the galaxy.
Use your skills to dodge, weave, and destroy enemy formations!
We created a custom starfield shader to bring the universe to life and composed original music for the full immersive experience.

HOW TO PLAY

Either use the arrow keys to rotate and move the rocket or use the joystick

Press the spacebar to fire lasers at enemies.

Travel from cluster to cluster and eliminate as many threats as possible before the timer runs out.

Try to survive as long as you can and rack up as many points a possible. !
